Before proceeding, lets first start up R and download the devtools package. install.packages(&quot;devtools&quot;) # if required The workshops companion R package (Using R Packages for Reproducible Workflows) is available for download via devtools::install_github(repo = &quot;michaeldumelle/RPRW&quot;, ref = &quot;main&quot;) library(RPRW) Here are the sections of this workshop: Building an R Package Making an R Package a Research Compendium Extensions Exercise Solutions Acknowledgements I would like to thank Charlotte Wickham, Hadley Wickham, Jenny Bryan, and Yihui Xie for the immense impact their work has had on my programming journey. Much of this workshop draws from heavily their inspiration. I would also like to thank everyone who helped me hold this workshop. "],["r-package.html", "Chapter 1 Building an R Package 1.1 What is an R Package? 1.2 Creating an R Package 1.3 Debugging 1.4 Additional Resources", " Chapter 1 Building an R Package 1.1 What is an R Package? An R package is a collection of code, data, documentation, and tests with a particular structure that can be shared with others. R packages are commonly downloaded from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN). You can install them from CRAN with install.packages(\"package_name\"), load them in your workspace with library(\"package_name\"), and get help by running (help(package = \"package_name\")). One of the reasons R packages are so useful is because they are the fundamental way to share code in R. If your code is in a package, others can easily download and use it. If they are familiar with R packages, they likely will be familiar with how to use yours! But sharing R code is not the only benefit of creating R packages. Learning how to build an R package will provide several other benefits to future you! Future you will benefit from creating your own R packages because they enforce a particular structure. This structure Saves you time  you dont need to think about how to organize your files, R packages have a template! This was especially helpful for me because before learning how to create R packages, I would save my R files in all sorts of locations on my computer with all sorts of names. This made it very challenging to come back to my work later and find a particular file. Gives you standardized tools  people have created extremely useful tools that work with R packages, so take advantage of them! The R package devtools, which we downloaded earlier, contains many of these standarized tools. Requires documentation  This is especially helpful for future you. Before I started using R packages, when I would come back my old code, I was convinced someone else wrote it  I basically had to rewrite it all to understand it. R packages help prevent this. Is reproducible  R packages are built from R projects (see here and here), so file paths are relative, not absolute! read_csv(\"a_fun_csv_file.csv\") works on my machine  and yours! While R projects are not the fundamental focus on today, I highly, highly recommend you use them for every data analysis project that you are not using an R package for. Guides your data analysis  We will talk about this today See Marwick, Boettiger, and Mullen (2018) for more! 1.1.1 Exercises What are some of your favorite R packages? Of those we have talked about so far, what benefits of R packages are most appealing to you? 1.2 Creating an R Package Together, we will create the companion package for this workshop! If this is your first R package, then an extra special congratulations to you  this is a big milestone! The name of the package is 1.2.1 The Motivating Dataset Suppose we want to build an R package that summarizes length (in kilometers) and discharge (meters per second cubed) of North American rivers based on the names of the rivers. Below is our data of interest river &lt;- data.frame( Missouri = c(3768, 1956), Mississippi = c(3544, 18400), Yukon = c(3190, 6340), Colorado = c(2330, 40), Arkansas = c(2322, 1004), Columbia = c(2000, 7730), Red = c(1811, 852), Canadian = c(1458, 174) ) rownames(river) &lt;- c(&quot;length&quot;, &quot;discharge&quot;) river #&gt; Missouri Mississippi Yukon Colorado Arkansas Columbia Red Canadian #&gt; length 3768 3544 3190 2330 2322 2000 1811 1458 #&gt; discharge 1956 18400 6340 40 1004 7730 852 174 1.2.2 The First Step devtools::create_package(&quot;path_to_RPRW_package/RPRW&quot;)  Creating &#39;path_to_RPRW_package/RPRW/&#39;  Setting active project to &#39;path_to_RPRW_package/RPRW&#39;  Creating &#39;R/&#39;  Writing &#39;DESCRIPTION&#39; Package: RPRW Title: What the Package Does (One Line, Title Case) Version: 0.0.0.9000 Authors@R (parsed): * First Last &lt;first.last@example.com&gt; [aut, cre] (YOUR-ORCID-ID) Description: What the package does (one paragraph). License: `use_mit_license()`, `use_gpl3_license()` or friends to pick a license Encoding: UTF-8 LazyData: true Roxygen: list(markdown = TRUE) RoxygenNote: 7.1.1  Writing &#39;NAMESPACE&#39;  Writing &#39;RPRW.Rproj&#39;  Adding &#39;^RPRW\\\\.Rproj$&#39; to &#39;.Rbuildignore&#39;  Adding &#39;.Rproj.user&#39; to &#39;.gitignore&#39;  Adding &#39;^\\\\.Rproj\\\\.user$&#39; to &#39;.Rbuildignore&#39;  Opening &#39;path_to_RPRW_package/RPRW/&#39; in new RStudio session  Setting active project to &#39;&lt;no active project&gt;&#39;  Setting active project to &#39;path_to_RPRW_package/RPRW&#39; In the Files pane of RStudio (bottom right corner), you will see that your folder has been populated with a few new files and a new folder. We will focus on some of these next. You will also notice that the Environment pane of RStudio (top right corner) now has a Build tab  this tab contains some useful tools for your R package. R (folder): Where functions in your R package are stored Description: This contains metadata for your package Namespace: Information about 1) functions from other packages your package uses and 2) what functions in your package you make available to others 1.2.3 The First Function The R folder is where functions in your R package are stored. Lets create our first function, called river_medians(), which finds the median of river length and discharge of desired rivers. Generally, the name of your file should match the name of the function, and you should use separate files for separate functions. More experienced users, it is okay to break this rule every once in a while in certain contexts. To create an R file in the R folder, run use_r(&quot;river_means&quot;) You will see some output in the console * Modify &#39;R/river_means.R&#39; * Call `use_test()` to create a matching test file and the appropriate file now in your R folder. Now lets write our function. We want this function to take the mean length and discharge of all rivers whose names have a common pattern. river_means &lt;- function(data, pattern) { desired_rivers &lt;- grep(pattern, names(data)) new_data &lt;- data[, desired_rivers] rowMeans(new_data) } The first line of code finds the variables in the data whose names match the pattern. The second line of code subsets the data to include only the desired variables. The third line of code finds and returns the mean length and mean discharge of the desired variables. If you would like, you can leave comments in the code (using #) to remind yourself what each line of code does. This is usually good practice, as it can help others (and future you) understand the intent of your code line-by-line. 1.2.4 load_all() So we have written this function, how should we try it out? Well you could run the function or source it (source(\"R/river_means.R\")), but this puts it in our global workspace, and if you are not careful, global workspaces can get messy. The devtools function load_all() emulates the process of building, installing, and loading our R package, making all of your functions available via a single line of code. As your package becomes more complicated, it is much easier to try our your functions using load_all() than navigating the global workspace. load_all() Now lets try out our function! What if we want our summary for the rivers starting with Mi (Missiouri and Mississippi)? river_means(river, &quot;Mi&quot;) #&gt; length discharge #&gt; 3656 10178 Or what if we want our summary for rivers starting with Y (Yukon) or R (Red)? river_means(river, &quot;Y|R&quot;) #&gt; length discharge #&gt; 2500.5 3596.0 Hooray  our function works! Give yourself a congratulations :)! 1.2.4.1 Exercises How many functions does river_means() call within the body of the function? What package are these functions in? 1.2.5 Creating Package Data So far we have used the river data from our global workspace. But what if we want this to be data that is included as part of the R packages so that others (or future you) have easy access to it? This is the place for use_data() use_data(river)  Creating &#39;data/&#39;  Saving &#39;river&#39; to &#39;data/river.rda&#39; You will see that at the root of your R package, there is a folder called data, and in that folder is a file called rivers.rda, which contains the rivers data. For illustration, lets remove rivers from our global workspace and then load it like we would data from any other package rm(river) # remove the river data from our global workspace load_all() # emulate package building process data(&quot;river&quot;) # load the river data river 1.2.6 roxygen Comments Now that you have written your function, it is time to thoroughly document your function so that others (or future you) can understand how to use it. The documentation for R functions uses special types of comments called roxygen comments. The comments use #' and have special tags associated with them. To insert a template of roxygen comments into river_means(), put your cursor somewhere in the river_means() function and either In the upper-left toolbar, go to Code -&gt; Insert Roxygen Skeleton Press Ctrl/Cmd + Alt + Shift + R You will see river_means() now looks like #&#39; Title #&#39; #&#39; @param data #&#39; @param pattern #&#39; #&#39; @return #&#39; @export #&#39; #&#39; @examples river_means &lt;- function(data, pattern) { desired_rivers &lt;- grep(pattern, names(data)) new_data &lt;- data[, desired_rivers] rowMeans(new_data) } The @ indicates a particular tag that controls how functions are documented. @param: for documenting arguments to a function @return: for documenting the function output @export: for making this function available to others downloading your package @examples: to give examples for how to use the package Lets fill these in. #&#39; Means of river lengths and discharges #&#39; #&#39; @param data A data frame with two rows. The first row indicates river length and #&#39; second row indicates river discharge. The columns of data indicate river names. #&#39; @param pattern A pattern by which to include only particular rivers #&#39; #&#39; @return The mean river length and mean river discharge for the desired rivers #&#39; @export #&#39; #&#39; @examples #&#39; data(&quot;rivers&quot;) #&#39; river_means(rivers, pattern = &quot;Mi&quot;) river_means &lt;- function(data, pattern) { desired_rivers &lt;- grep(pattern, names(data)) new_data &lt;- data[, desired_rivers] rowMeans(new_data) } To view this documentation as you would any other packages function documentation, first run document() i Updating RPRW documentation i Loading RPRW Writing NAMESPACE Writing river_means.Rd You will notice that there is a new folder at the root of the package, called man, which contains a file called river_means.Rd. The contents of the file here are not too important, as this file is automatically created using document(). The important point is that after running document(), you can view the documentation of your function! ?river_means There are several other tags available to customize your documentation  for more information about these tags and documenting data (which is different than documentation function; the rivers data is documented in the RPRW package hosted on GitHub), see here. Though we skip it here, the RPRW package source does document the rivers data and can be viewed using ?rivers after loading RPRW. 1.2.7 The Second Function In river_means(), we used a few functions: &lt;-, grep(), names(), [, and rowMeans(). These functions are all from the base package, which is a special package in the way that it operates with R packages. If you use functions from the base package in your package, you dont have to give R any warning. If you use a function from another package, however, you do need to let R know where that function is coming from. Next we explore this. Suppose we want to create a function in our package that computes the mean instead of a mean. First we run use_r(&quot;river_medians&quot;) Then we write the function. Note that there is no rowMedians() function, so we use apply() to summarize across rows (see ?apply for more detail). river_medians &lt;- function(data, pattern) { desired_rivers &lt;- grep(pattern, names(data)) new_data &lt;- data[, desired_rivers] apply(new_data, 1, median) } But wait! Youll notice that the function median() is in the stats package, not the base package (run ?median to check). So we need to let R know that we will be using a function from a package that is not the base package. To accomplish this, there are two steps to take. First, you need to tell R that you are using another package use_package(&quot;stats&quot;)  Adding &#39;stats&#39; to Imports field in DESCRIPTION * Refer to functions with `stats::fun()` You will notice that the package stats was added to the Imports field in the DESCRIPTION file  we will get to DESCRIPTION later, but for now just remember that it contains metadata about your package. You only need to run use_package(\"stats\") once per package. That is, if you are using a different function from stats, you dont need to run use_package(\"stats\") again. Second, you need to tell the river_median() function to use the median() function from the stats package. The best practice is to preface any function from outside the base package with packagename::. This adjustment to river_median() yields river_medians &lt;- function(data, pattern) { desired_rivers &lt;- grep(pattern, names(data)) new_data &lt;- data[, desired_rivers] apply(new_data, 1, stats::median) } Though this is the best practice, it does add some extra typing and can be cumbersome if you are using outside functions often. The packagename:: prefix can be avoided if you import median() to river_median() using the roxygen tag @importFrom #&#39; Medians of river lengths and discharges #&#39; #&#39; @param data A data frame with two rows. The first row indicates river length and #&#39; second row indicates river discharge. The columns of data indicate river names. #&#39; @param pattern A pattern by which to include only particular rivers #&#39; #&#39; @return The median river length and mean river discharge for the desired rivers #&#39; @importFrom stats median #&#39; @export #&#39; #&#39; @examples #&#39; data(&quot;rivers&quot;) #&#39; river_medians(rivers, pattern = &quot;Mi&quot;) river_medians &lt;- function(data, pattern) { desired_rivers &lt;- grep(pattern, names(data)) new_data &lt;- data[, desired_rivers] apply(new_data, 1, median) } If you are using several functions from stats, it may be easier to use the @import tag, which imports all functions from a package at once. #&#39; Medians of river lengths and discharges #&#39; #&#39; @param data A data frame with two rows. The first row indicates river length and #&#39; second row indicates river discharge. The columns of data indicate river names. #&#39; @param pattern A pattern by which to include only particular rivers #&#39; #&#39; @return The median river length and mean river discharge for the desired rivers #&#39; @import stats #&#39; @export #&#39; #&#39; @examples #&#39; data(&quot;rivers&quot;) #&#39; river_medians(rivers, pattern = &quot;Mi&quot;) river_medians &lt;- function(data, pattern) { desired_rivers &lt;- grep(pattern, names(data)) new_data &lt;- data[, desired_rivers] apply(new_data, 1, median) } Be careful when using @importFrom or @import to ensure that two functions from different packages dont have the same name  this is when using packagename:: to prefix the function is crucial. 1.2.7.1 Exercises Play around with using these functions for some new patterns  do you notice anything strange? These exercises are more challenging, so if they dont make sense now, that is okay! Make sure to re-review the solutions after the workshop. Write a new function, river_stat(), that takes a data frame, pattern, and a general function by which to summarize river length and discharge. This general function should not be an actual function but rather a placeholder so that a user may insert their own function as an argument. Rewrite river_stat() so that it also takes additional arguments to the summarizing function (hint: use ... as an argument) 1.2.8 DESCRIPTION The DESCRIPTION file is automatically added while creating an R package and contains the R packages metadata. Package: RPRW Title: R Packages for Reproducible Workflows Version: 0.0.0.9000 Authors@R: person(given = &quot;Michael&quot;, family = &quot;Dumelle&quot;, role = c(&quot;aut&quot;, &quot;cre&quot;), email = &quot;first.last@example.com&quot;) Description: A companion R package for &quot;Using R Packages for Reproducible Workflows&quot; at the 2021 EPA R Workshop. License: `use_mit_license()`, `use_gpl3_license()` or friends to pick a license Encoding: UTF-8 LazyData: true Roxygen: list(markdown = TRUE) RoxygenNote: 7.1.1 Depends: R (&gt;= 2.10) Imports: stats The DESCRIPTION file is where you track version numbers, authorship, and additional R packages that your R package uses. Two fields in DESCRIPTION do most of the communication regarding how your R package uses additional R packages: Imports: Packages here must be installed in order for your package to work. As a result, any package listed in Imports will be installed alongside your package. Packages in Imports help build the foundation of your package. Suggests: Packages here enhance your package but are not required for your package to work. You might use suggested packages for enhanced plotting, additional data sets, or more. Packages in Suggests can add finishing touches to your package, but they are not part of your packages foundation. Other fields used to communicate how your R package uses additional R packages are Depends, LinkingTo, and Enhances. The difference between Depends and Imports is subtle  the general advice is to use Imports instead of Depends. 1.2.9 NAMESPACE While the DESCRIPTION file communicates what packages your package uses, the NAMESPACE file communicates how your package uses these packages. More specifically, the NAMESPACE file controls which functions your package exports (makes available to others) and what functions from what packages must be available for your exported functions to work. This file is automatically generated by devtools and should not be edited by hand. In river_median(), if you called median using stats::median, your NAMESPACE file will look like # Generated by roxygen2: do not edit by hand export(river_means) export(river_medians) If you used the @importFrom stats median approach, your NAMESPACE will look like # Generated by roxygen2: do not edit by hand export(river_means) export(river_medians) importFrom(stats,median) If you used the @import stats approach, your NAMESPACE will look like # Generated by roxygen2: do not edit by hand export(river_means) export(river_medians) import(stats) 1.2.10 testthat Testing your code to make sure that it performs as intended is an important step in the package building process. Though upfront, it may seem like extra work, implementing a rigorous testing procedure for your package will provide several benefits: fewer bugs, better code structure, easier restarts, and robust code. In R, testing is incorporated into your package through the testthat package. To begin using testthat, run use_testthat()  Adding &#39;testthat&#39; to Suggests field in DESCRIPTION  Setting Config/testthat/edition field in DESCRIPTION to &#39;3&#39;  Creating &#39;tests/testthat/&#39;  Writing &#39;tests/testthat.R&#39; The root of your package directory shoudl look like The tests folder should look like Tests are generally written on a function-by-function basis. All tests for a function are contained in an R script titled test-function_name. For example, to start testing river_means(), run use_test(&quot;river_means&quot;)  Writing &#39;tests/testthat/test-river_means.R&#39; * Modify &#39;tests/testthat/test-river_means.R&#39; Your testthat folder should look like Tests can be fairly detailed and cover many components of a function (such as input types, output types, function output, etc.). Here we write a simple test that calculates whether our function, river_means(), yields output that we would expect if we calculated the means by hand for an example scenario where our pattern includes Missouri and Mississippi. test_that(&quot;the mean length is calculated correctly in a test case&quot;, { # calculate values required for the test for length ## calculate the means from the function river_means_val &lt;- river_means(river, &quot;Missouri|Mississippi&quot;) river_means_length &lt;- river_means_val[[1]] ## calculate the means &quot;by hand&quot; raw_vec_length &lt;- unlist(river[&quot;length&quot;, c(&quot;Missouri&quot;, &quot;Mississippi&quot;)]) raw_means_length &lt;- mean(raw_vec_length) # perform the actual test for length ## check that the function and &quot;by hand&quot; output matches expect_equal(river_means_length, raw_means_length) }) #&gt; Error in test_that(&quot;the mean length is calculated correctly in a test case&quot;, : could not find function &quot;test_that&quot; The tests in testthat are prefixed with expect_. If you have many tests, the test() function runs all of them in the testthat folder: test() i Loading RPRW i Testing RPRW  | OK F W S | Context  | 1 | river_means == Results ========================================================================= [ FAIL 0 | WARN 0 | SKIP 0 | PASS 1 ] We can write a similar test for discharge and then repeat the process for river_meadians(). Then test() returns test() i Loading RPRW i Testing RPRW  | OK F W S | Context  | 2 | river_means  | 2 | river_medians == Results ========================================================================= [ FAIL 0 | WARN 0 | SKIP 0 | PASS 4 ] All tests pass  hooray! I want to again emphasize how important testing is. I know that it seems like an extra chore, but in my experience, writing careful tests has always paid offwith interest. 1.2.10.1 Exercises Write similar tests for river_means() (discharge), river_medians() (length), and river_medians() (length) 1.2.11 License At some point, your package needs a license. The license places restrictions on how your package can be shared with others. Licensing can be complicated quickly, so I refer you here for more information. For illustration purposes, we will use a GPL-3 license for this package. use_gpl_license()  Setting active project to &#39;path_to_RPRW_package/RPRW&#39;  Setting License field in DESCRIPTION to &#39;GPL (&gt;= 3)&#39;  Writing &#39;LICENSE.md&#39;  Adding &#39;^LICENSE\\\\.md$&#39; to &#39;.Rbuildignore&#39; The licensing update will be reflected in the DESCRIPTION file. 1.2.12 Vignettes Vignettes act as high-level user guides for your package. A vignette acts as the glue that binds together all the documentation from the individual functions to solve a particular problem. Typically, they guide the user through a typical workflow one would experience while using your package. The ggplot2 package is a popular package for visualizing data. After installing ggplot2 install.packages(&quot;ggplot2&quot;) you can view its available vignettes by running vignette(package = &quot;ggplot2&quot;) A file will pop up alongside your R scripts with the contents Then to view a specific vignette, run vignette(topic, package). For example, to view the vignette regarding aesthetic specifications, run vignette(&quot;ggplot2-specs&quot;, &quot;ggplot2&quot;) You will then see the vignette in the bottom-right hand pane of RStudio. Vignettes are also available on a packages CRAN page  for the ggplot2 aesthetic specifications vignette, see here. To include vignettes in your R package, first run use_vignette(&quot;river-statistics&quot;, &quot;River Statistics&quot;)  Adding &#39;knitr&#39; to Suggests field in DESCRIPTION  Setting VignetteBuilder field in DESCRIPTION to &#39;knitr&#39;  Adding &#39;inst/doc&#39; to &#39;.gitignore&#39;  Creating &#39;vignettes/&#39;  Adding &#39;*.html&#39;, &#39;*.R&#39; to &#39;vignettes/.gitignore&#39;  Adding &#39;rmarkdown&#39; to Suggests field in DESCRIPTION  Writing &#39;vignettes/river-statistics.Rmd&#39; * Modify &#39;vignettes/river-statistics.Rmd&#39; A few things happen after running use_vignette(): your DESCRIPTION file is edited, a vignettes folder is inserted into the root of your directory, and a .Rmd file is added to the vignettes folder. The .Rmd file extension indicates that the vignette is an RMarkdown document. RMarkdown documents provide a convenient way to create dynamic documents. Dynamic documents combine code and text and form the foundation for reproducible report writing in R. More on RMarkdown is available here, here and here. I highly recommend you get some experience with it, as its tools are quite powerful. While we wont create a vignette for our package during the workshop, I have added a vignette to the companion R package. After installation, it can be viewed by running vignette(river-statistics, &quot;RPRW&quot;) 1.2.13 check() So now we have built our R package and are ready to share it with the world! But we should probably check to make sure we did not make any small mistakes? This is what check() does  it runs through a series of checks on your package to make sure it can be properly installed and shared. check() takes a few minutes to run, but it will return errors, warnings, and notes associated with your package. Though the warnings and notes are important, it is most crucial to address the errors immediately. Hopefully your output after running check() looks like -- R CMD check results ---------- RPRW 0.0.0.9000 ---- Duration: 34.4s 0 errors  | 0 warnings  | 0 notes  1.2.14 install() After check() returns zero errors (and hopefully zero warnings and notes), you can install your package by running install() After installation, you can use library() to load your package (like you do any other R package). 1.2.15 Congratulations Congratulations on building an R package! 1.3 Debugging Even the best of programmers write code that may fail in unintended ways. This is referred to as a bug, and the process of fixing the bug is known as debugging. Dont expect to always write perfect code  do expect to have the tools necessary to track down bugs and remedy them. Though we went through a rigorous documentation and testing procedure when creating river_means() and river_medians(), there are still bugs present in these functions. 1.3.1 A Mysterious Error Message We have used river_means() and river_medians() to successfully find means and medians for all sorts of river combinations. But running river_means(river, &quot;R&quot;) #&gt; Error in rowMeans(new_data): &#39;x&#39; must be an array of at least two dimensions yields a mystifying error. Something is wrong  and we need to figure out what. A good first step is to copy and paste the error into a Google search engine and see if anyone has solved the problem yet. If you are lucky, this will help you find the bug. If not, you need to use another approach. Fortunately, R has tools to help isolate bugs. 1.3.2 traceback() The traceback() function is run after code generating an error and it identifies where the error occurred. traceback() 3: stop(&quot;&#39;x&#39; must be an array of at least two dimensions&quot;) 2: rowMeans(new_data) at #4 1: river_means(rivers, &quot;R&quot;) Locating the source of bugs goes a long way towards removing them. Here, we see that the function failed at the rowMeans() step of river_means() (line #4 of river_means(). While useful, we still dont exactly know why the error is occurring. 1.3.3 browser() Before I learned about browser(), I would try to debug by storing my arguments locally (so that they were in the global environment) and then sequentially running each line of the function one-at-a-time. Perhaps some of you have done this too. Unfortunately, for many reasons (which we dont discuss in detail today), its an inferior method of debugging compared to browser(). The browser() method involves inserting browser() into the body of your function. Running your function with browser() inside of it then lets you interactively step into the function at browser(). No more storing arguments and running code line-by-line! Lets try this out with river_means() river_means &lt;- function(data, pattern) { browser() desired_rivers &lt;- grep(pattern, names(data)) new_data &lt;- data[, desired_rivers] rowMeans(new_data) } Now when running river_means(), you will step into the function. For example, river_means(river, &quot;R&quot;) will open a new file that looks like In your new interactive context, you will see a few buttons in the R console (lower left-hand window) These are five buttons to type into the console and evaluate (Enter/Return) that let you navigate the interactive context. In order (left to right), they are Next (n) executes the next line of the code Step (s) steps into the function called by the current line of code Finish (f) finishes execution of the current function Continue (c) leaves the interactive context and continues execution of the function Stop (Q) leaves the interactive context and terminates execution of the function In the interactive context of river_means(), we see data and pattern are defined: print(data) #&gt; Missouri Mississippi Yukon Colorado Arkansas Columbia Red Canadian #&gt; length 3768 3544 3190 2330 2322 2000 1811 1458 #&gt; discharge 1956 18400 6340 40 1004 7730 852 174 print(pattern) #&gt; [1] &quot;R&quot; Pressing n executes browser(). Pressing n again executes desired_rivers &lt;- grep(pattern, names(data)) Inspecting desired_rivers, we see print(desired_rivers) #&gt; [1] 7 This seems correct, so the error does not appear to be here. Lets press n to evaluate the next line new_data &lt;- data[, desired_rivers] Inspecting new_data, we see new_data #&gt; [1] 1811 852 Well this seems weird  it does not look like a data frame. Lets inspect the structure str(new_data) #&gt; num [1:2] 1811 852 It is not a data frame, but rather a numeric vector. Because rowMeans() requires an array of two or more dimensions (e.g. matrix or data frame), the next line of code fails. Pressing n again returns the error and removes you from the interactive context rowMeans(new_data) #&gt; Error in rowMeans(new_data): &#39;x&#39; must be an array of at least two dimensions A similar error occurs within river_medians() when running apply() So what is happening here? We know the code works when the pattern yields at least two matches in rivers, and we know the code behaves oddly when the pattern only has one match. Looking at the documentation of [ we see a drop argument, which coerces to the lowest possible dimension when equal to TRUE. When subsetting data frames, drop is TRUE by default. So when subsetting a data frame using a single column, the data frame structure is only preserved when drop = FALSE. Accommodating this change in river_means() and river_medians() yields functions whose bodies looks like river_means &lt;- function(data, pattern) { desired_rivers &lt;- grep(pattern, names(data)) new_data &lt;- data[, desired_rivers, drop = FALSE] rowMeans(new_data) } river_medians &lt;- function(data, pattern) { desired_rivers &lt;- grep(pattern, names(data)) new_data &lt;- data[, desired_rivers, drop = FALSE] apply(new_data, 1, median) } Running these functions with pattern = \"R\" behaves as intended river_means(river, &quot;R&quot;) #&gt; length discharge #&gt; 1811 852 river_medians(river, &quot;R&quot;) #&gt; length discharge #&gt; 1811 852 For more information about debugging in R, watch or read. 1.3.4 Another Error  No Mysterious Message We received and fixed an error message that occurred when the pattern only matched one river. But what happens when it matches zero rivers? river_means(river, &quot;ZZZ&quot;) river_medians(river, &quot;ZZZ&quot;) These types of bugs are especially pernicious because there is no error message associated with them. Whenever the output is unexpected, use browser() to diagnose the problem. In this context, desired_rivers is a length-zero vector, which causes problems in the remaining parts of the function. To guard against these types of bugs, program defensively and force the function to return an error message early. river_means &lt;- function(data, pattern) { desired_rivers &lt;- grep(pattern, names(data)) if (length(desired_rivers) == 0) { stop(&quot;This is an error message that stops the function&quot;) } new_data &lt;- data[, desired_rivers, drop = FALSE] rowMeans(new_data) } river_means(rivers, &quot;ZZZ&quot;) #&gt; Error in river_means(rivers, &quot;ZZZ&quot;): This is an error message that stops the function 1.3.4.1 Exercises Rewrite river_medians() so that it stops when no patterns are matched and returns an informative error message. 1.4 Additional Resources R Packages by Hadley Wickham and Jenny Bryan Writing an R package from scratch by Hilary Parker Writing R Extensions by CRAN (this resource is very technical) References "],["r-package-research-compendium.html", "Chapter 2 Making an R Package a Research Compendium 2.1 What is a Research Compendium? 2.2 Why a Research Compendium? 2.3 Why an R Package for a Research Compendium? 2.4 Turning RPRW Into A Research Compendium 2.5 Recap 2.6 Sharing Your Research Compendium", " Chapter 2 Making an R Package a Research Compendium 2.1 What is a Research Compendium? Marwick, Boettiger, and Mullen (2018) state that the goal of a research compendium is to provide a standard and easily recognizable way to organize the digital materials of a project to enable others to inspect, reproduce, and extend the research. Three generic principles define research compendium: Files should be organized according to the prevailing conventions of a broader community. This helps members of the community recognize the structure of the project and make tools that utilize the structure. There should be a clear separation of data, methods, and output. For example, raw data should be kept separate from the code that cleans the data so that others can access the raw data. The computational environment for the methods should be clearly specified. At the most basic level, this means recording the names and version numbers of software. At the most detailed level, this means completely reproducing the computing environment 2.1.1 Exercises Can you identify any benefits to a research compendium? 2.2 Why a Research Compendium? Marwick, Boettiger, and Mullen (2018) (and references therein) give several benefits of a research compendium: A convenient way to publicly share data and code Work with publicly available data sets may receive higher numbers of citations than work with private data sets (note that publicly available data sets also tend to be easier to clear through EPA platforms) Data sharing is associated with higher publication productivity Of 7,040 NSF and NIH awards studied, the median number of publications associated with each research grant was five when the data were private and 10 when the data were public Structured and simplified file management and workflows More defense against errors Easier to communicate with others (and future you) 2.2.1 Exercises Can you identify any benefits to a research compendium that are not already on this list? 2.3 Why an R Package for a Research Compendium? As previously mentioned, a research compendium requires a specific structure. Earlier in this workshop, we got some experience with something in R that also requires a specific structureR packages! A research compendium can significantly benefit from adopting the structure of an R package. Organization is simpler (as you already have a structure), writing and documenting functions and data helps guard against errors in an analysis, and devtools have several development tools to help ensure your R package performs as intended. We have previously discussed how to include data in an R package, but many of you may be wondering how we include additional pieces of a research compendium like analysis scripts, output, or a manuscript itself. If the structure of an R package is so rigid  how do these pieces fit? We discuss one such approach next. 2.4 Turning RPRW Into A Research Compendium If a folder named inst is placed at the root of an R packages directory, all of its raw contents will be installed upon installation of the R package. This is where we can put the pieces of our research compendium that are not explicitly related to the previous implementation of our R package. We can use this approach to turn RPRW into a research compendium. Suppose we are using RPRW to supplement a manuscript about rivers. Lets first add the inst folder  the root of your packages directory should look similar to Lets add three folders to inst: analysis for our analysis scripts output for our analysis output manuscript for our manuscript Lets make an R script to put in analysis whose contents look like # find some summary statistics on rivers with pattern &quot;C&quot; library(RPRW) ## find minimums river_min &lt;- river_stats(river, &quot;C&quot;, min) min_df &lt;- data.frame( data = &quot;river&quot;, pattern = &quot;C&quot;, length_min = river_min[[1]], discharge_min = river_min[[2]] ) write.csv(min_df, &quot;inst/output/min_df&quot;, row.names = FALSE) This R script loads RPRW and finds the minimum length and discharge for rivers whose names start with C. The script then saves the contents to a CSV file in the output folder. These contents are used when building the manuscript about rivers. The manuscript in the manuscript folder is an RMarkdown document that is completely reproducible. Though we wont discuss the details here unless we have time, the files can be viewed on your machine (after installing RPRW) at the location provided by system.file(&quot;manuscript&quot;, package = &quot;RPRW&quot;) A compiled PDF of the manuscript is available here. Lets talk about its structure for a few minutes. 2.4.1 Exercises There is a folder name within inst that should be avoided  what is it? 2.4.2 Adding a Citation You can add a citation to your R package research compendium by running use_citation()  Writing &#39;inst/CITATION&#39; * Modify &#39;inst/CITATION&#39; The citation file is placed in the inst folder. It looks a little intimidating at first, but it automatically creates a text version and LaTeX version of your citation with relatively little ease. Here is raw code I used to create the citation in the RPRW package citHeader(&quot;To cite RPRW in publications use:&quot;) citEntry( entry = &quot;Manual&quot;, title = &quot;Using R Packages for Reproducible Workflows&quot;, author = personList(as.person(&quot;Michael Dumelle&quot;)), journal = &quot;EPA 2021 R Workshop&quot;, url = &quot;https://github.com/michaeldumelle/R-Packages-Reproducible-Workflows-Book&quot;, textVersion = paste( &quot;Michael Dumelle.&quot;, &quot;(2021).&quot;, &quot;Using R Packages for Reproducible Workflows.&quot;, &quot;EPA 2021 R Workshop.&quot;, &quot;URL https://github.com/michaeldumelle/R-Packages-Reproducible-Workflows-Book.&quot; ) ) Then you can run citation(package = &quot;RPRW&quot;) #&gt; #&gt; To cite RPRW in publications use: #&gt; #&gt; Michael Dumelle. (2021). Using R Packages for Reproducible Workflows. #&gt; EPA 2021 R Workshop. URL #&gt; https://github.com/michaeldumelle/R-Packages-Reproducible-Workflows-Book. #&gt; #&gt; A BibTeX entry for LaTeX users is #&gt; #&gt; @Manual{, #&gt; title = {Using R Packages for Reproducible Workflows}, #&gt; author = {Michael Dumelle}, #&gt; journal = {EPA 2021 R Workshop}, #&gt; url = {https://github.com/michaeldumelle/R-Packages-Reproducible-Workflows-Book}, #&gt; } Editing these citations in this way is most useful when you want to cite the manuscript in your reserach compendium  not the R package itself. If left unedited, the package citation exist by default and look like #&gt; #&gt; To cite package &#39;RPRW&#39; in publications use: #&gt; #&gt; Michael Dumelle (2021). RPRW: R Packages for Reproducible Workflows. #&gt; R package version 0.0.0.9000. #&gt; #&gt; A BibTeX entry for LaTeX users is #&gt; #&gt; @Manual{, #&gt; title = {RPRW: R Packages for Reproducible Workflows}, #&gt; author = {Michael Dumelle}, #&gt; year = {2021}, #&gt; note = {R package version 0.0.0.9000}, #&gt; } 2.5 Recap So what does our research compendium look like now? data: folder containing data DESCRIPTION: file containing metadata about our package inst: folder containing auxiliary files to be downloaded alongside the packages installation analysis: folder containing R scripts that are separate from the R package but used as part of the research compendium CITATION: file containing citation information mamuscript: output: LICENSE.md: file containing metadata about our license (GPL-3) man: folder containing R function documentation from the package NAMESPACE: file containing exports and imports R: folder containing R functions from the package RPRW.Rproj: file containing R Project metadata tests: folder containing R function testing vignettes: folder containing the package vignette You can also add a README.md file to give a broad overview of your package. The README.md file in the RPRW package looks like # RPRW Companion R package for &quot;Using R Packages for Reproducible Workflows&quot; at the 2021 EPA R Workshop 2.5.1 An Example R Package Reserach Compendium A recent journal article of mine used this R package research compendium structure  you can view the GitHub repository here. 2.6 Sharing Your Research Compendium So now you have a research compendium that combines your R functions with your data, code, and manuscript to create a reproducible product that is easy to share with your colleagues. But how do we share it? Running devtools::build() will build an R package for you. By default, the package will be located in the same folder as the folder containing your R package with name package-name_version-number.tar.gz. Note that this is one level above the location of your R packages directory. For example, if folder A holds RPRW, which is the folder containing all of the files associated with my R package, then using devtools::build() will install RPRW_0.0.0.9000.tar.gz in folder A. After building the package, you can send it to a colleague, they can save it on their machine, and then they can install it by running install.packages(path_to_package, repos = NULL, type = &quot;source&quot;) If your colleague doesnt remember where they saved the file, they can interactively search for it by running install.packages(file.choose(), repos = NULL, type = &quot;source&quot;) Because R packages leverage R projects, all file paths are relative (not absolute), and your colleague can immediately run any of your code on their machine! 2.6.1 Exercises Run ?devtools::build to look at some additional arguments  which seem useful to you? References "],["extensions.html", "Chapter 3 Extensions 3.1 R Projects 3.2 R Markdown 3.3 rticles 3.4 Git and GitHub 3.5 Continuous Integration 3.6 Extra", " Chapter 3 Extensions 3.1 R Projects When I first started coding in R, I would try to share my code with others and encountered a problem  my code would not work on their machine. This is because in my R scripts I would often read in files from different locations on my computer. The paths that point to the objects to read in were specific to my machine. Then when I colleague tried to run my script  it failed! To get my code to work, they would have edit the file paths to point to the correct objects on their machine. Not only is this a lot to ask of someone, it also makes it incredibly easy to introduce errors. More often than not, I would have to meet with someone to get the code I sent them up and running. This was a waste of time for everyone involved. R looks for files to load in a working directory. This is helpful because looking for files in a working directory prevents you from having to type out the full path to a file every time you want to load something. For example, you are not using a working directory and you have several files to load that live in a/long/path/with/s p a c e s/or/weird/cH-a_r--aCt-er$!!!. To load my_cool_file.csv and my_other_cool_file.csv, you have to run read.csv(&quot;a/long/path/with/s p a c e s/and/weird/cH-a_r--aCt-er$!!!/my_cool_file.csv&quot;) and then retype (or copy/paste) the path to run read.csv(&quot;a/long/path/with/s p a c e s/and/weird/cH-a_r--aCt-er$!!!/my_other_cool_file.csv&quot;) This workflow is tedious and error-prone. If you set your working directory to a/really/long/path/with/s p a c e s/or/weird/cH-a_r--aCt-er$!!!, then to load my_cool_file.csv and my_other_cool_file.csv, you have to run read.csv(&quot;my_cool_file.csv&quot;) read.csv(&quot;my_other_cool_file.csv&quot;) You can set working directories in R using setwd(), but this isnt really a good idea for various reasons (you get to discuss them in the exercises). There is a better way to control your working directory  insert R projects to the rescue! R projects automatically set your working directory to live wherever the project is stored on your machine. So if I have my_cool_file.csv and my_other_cool_file.csv in the root of my R project, I can load them by running read.csv(&quot;my_cool_file.csv&quot;) read.csv(&quot;my_other_cool_file.csv&quot;) while inside the R project. This is so powerful because that means I can bundle up my R project, send it to my colleague, and then the R project will set my colleagues working directory to live wherever they save the project. That means that they can load my_cool_file.csv and my_other_cool_file.csv using the exact same code I used. No more file path problems  this is a vastly improved workflow. It may not seem like a huge deal now, but learning how to use R projects can make a huge difference in your ability to share your work. Another benefit of R projects is that it provides a convenient structure to organize all the files associated with a particular task. To learn more about creating and maintaining R packages, check out this and this. 3.1.1 Exercises What are some drawbacks of running setwd() whenever you want to set a working directory? Look into the here package, designed to help solve working-directory problems (that can even occur within R Projects). 3.1.2 renv renv is an R package that brings R package version management to your projects. renv prevents code in your R project from returning separate results based on the version of the R packages installed. It works by saving the specific versions of the R packages in your project and then makes it easy for others to install those same versions before running code in the R project. 3.2 R Markdown R Markdown documents provide a convenient way to combine text, R code, and results into a fully reproducible document that compiles (knits) to one of several output types (HTLM, PDF, word, slide decks, etc.). An R Markdown document has file extension .Rmd and can be created in RStudio by clicking File -&gt; New File -&gt; R Markdown, which brings up the following options Pressing OK automatically opens a file with several contents --- title: &quot;Untitled&quot; author: &quot;Michael Dumelle&quot; date: &quot;9/17/2021&quot; output: html_document --- ```{r setup, include=FALSE} knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE) ``` ## R Markdown This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see &lt;http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com&gt;. When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this: ```{r cars} summary(cars) ``` ## Including Plots You can also embed plots, for example: ```{r pressure, echo=FALSE} plot(pressure) ``` Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot. The part surrounded by --- is the YAML header, which contains metadata about your document  big picture options are controlled here. The parts prefixed by # are first-level (section-level) headers, and the parts prefixed by ## are second level (subsection-level) headers. The parts surrounded by ``` are code chunks  these are the engine that powers R Markdown. Code chunks let you run and display R code and output in your document. More generally, code chunks look like ```{r label, chunk_options} R code ``` The line knitr::opts_chunk$set() lets you set default options for your code chunks. For example, knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE) sets echo = TRUE for all all code chunks, unless a particular code chunk sets echo = FALSE. More information on available code chunk options is here. Finally, the rest of the document contains the body of the document  the plain text. For more on the structure of R Markdown documents, see this. R Markdown documents are useful for a variety of reasons, two of which we will focus on next. R Markdown lets you create fully reproducible documents by combining R code and text. There is a slight change to the data? No problem, the tables or figures you are reproduced after changing the data. Suppose you want to knit to a new document style? No problem, just change output: This is very powerful. This approach is less error-prone that remaking tables, figures, etc on your own and then inserting them by hand into your document. For much, much more on R Markdown, read this and this. 3.2.1 Exercises Save the basic R Markdown template we just discussed and knit it to see its contents. 3.3 rticles The rticles is an extension of R Markdown designed to make adhering to journal style requirements easier. Some journal types rticles accommodates are Elsevier, PLOS, Sage, Springer, and Taylor &amp; Francis, among many more. After installing rticles (install.packages(\"rticles\")), you can access article templates by starting a new R Markdown document and selecting the template tab The rticles templates have complicated YAML headers, but they generally have pretty clear inline instructions for how to edit them. The YAML headers change between templates. The body of the document is just standard R Markdown (potentially with some LaTeX). This is so nice because the body of the document is the same across templates (potentially with minor LaTeX discrepancies that are generally explained in the templates inline instructions). Decide you want to switch from an Elsevier journal to a Taylor &amp; Francis journal? No problem, just change the template type! For this reason, rticles is one my favorite R packages. 3.4 Git and GitHub I highly recommend you learn how to use Git and GitHub. Though intimidating, frustrating, and time-consuming at first, Git and GitHub are well worth the effort. Git is a version control system. A version control system keeps track of all changes made to your code in a Git repository (which is a .git/ folder somewhere in your code  note the .git/ folder is usually hidden). Git is useful on its own, but it benefits greatly from integration with GitHub. GitHub is a website that lets you easily share your code, collaborate with others, track changes to your code, and backup your code, among other features. Git and GitHub is by far the most popular version control system for R packages, and access to development versions of R packages is usually only available through GitHub. devtools::install_github(&quot;username/packagename&quot;) Though we wont get into details of Git and GitHub here, luckily RStudio has many tools to enable R to communicate with Git and GitHub. For an intro to Git and GitHub through RStudio, visit here. For a thorough book about using Git and GitHub through RStudio, visit here. For a video overview of using Git and GitHub through RStudio, watch (here)[https://www.rstudio.com/resources/rstudioconf-2017/happy-git-and-gihub-for-the-user-tutorial/]. 3.5 Continuous Integration Continuous integration (often abbreviated CI) is the process of performing automated checks on code anytime it is updated. This may seem cumbersome, but it is a really good idea so that if an error is inserted in a new version of code, continuous integration helps identify that error. One option for continuous integration in your R packages GitHub repository is GitHub actions. devtools has several tools to help you set up GitHub actions. I recommend using their standard GitHub actions template, which can be added to your R project by running use_github_action(name = &quot;check-standard&quot;)  Creating &#39;.github/&#39;  Adding &#39;^\\\\.github$&#39; to &#39;.Rbuildignore&#39;  Adding &#39;*.html&#39; to &#39;.github/.gitignore&#39;  Creating &#39;.github/workflows/&#39;  Writing &#39;.github/workflows/check-standard.yaml&#39; * Learn more at &lt;https://github.com/r-lib/actions/blob/master/examples/README.md&gt; You will notice that this code created a new folder at the root of our package named .github. The .github folder may be hidden so you may need to enable the viewing of hidden files to look through its contents on your machine (in the files pane of R studio click more and check show hidden files. Then every time you push to GitHub, GitHub actions will simulate devtools::check() on several operating systems and return the results. This setup can be viewed for the RPRW package here. Another option for continuous integration is Travis CI. 3.6 Extra RStudio Cheat Sheets "],["exercise-solutions.html", "Chapter 4 Exercise Solutions", " Chapter 4 Exercise Solutions Q 1.

Play around with using these functions for some new patterns  do you notice anything strange? A 1. If zero matches or one match occur for a pattern, there is some unexpected behavior. If there are zero matches, you get NaN for an answer (which stands for not a number). river_means(rivers, &quot;ZZZ&quot;) If there is one match, you get a mysterious error  more on this later. river_means(rivers, &quot;Red&quot;) Q 1.
