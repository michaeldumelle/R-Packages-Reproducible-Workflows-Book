Welcome to the 2021 EPA R Workshop titled "Using R Packages for Reproducible Workflows" by me, Michael Dumelle -- I am glad to have you here! Before proceeding, let's download the companion R package

devtools::install_github(repo = "michaeldumelle/RPRWP", ref = "main")
library(RPRWP)
```

Here are the sections we will work through today.

), 'packages.bib')
```
