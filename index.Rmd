# Overview {-}

Welcome to the 2021 EPA R Workshop titled "Using R Packages for Reproducible Workflows" by me, Michael Dumelle -- I am glad to have you here! Before proceeding, let's first start up R and download the [devtools](https://devtools.r-lib.org/) package.
```{r}
install.packages("devtools") # if required
```

The workshop's companion R package (Using **R** **P**ackages for **R**eproducible **W**orkflows) is available for download via
```{r}
devtools::install_github(repo = "michaeldumelle/RPRW", ref = "main")
library(RPRW)
```


Here are the sections of this workshop:

1. [Building an R Package](#r-package)

2. [Making an R Package a Research Compendium](#r-package-research-compendium)

3. [Extensions](#extensions)

4. [Exercise Solutions](#exercise-solutions)

```{r, eval = TRUE, include = FALSE}
# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown', 'devtools'
), 'packages.bib')
```

I would like to thank Charlotte Wickham, Hadley Wickham, Jenny Bryan, and Yihui Xie for the immense impact their work has had on my programming journey. Much of this workshop draws from heavily their inspiration. I would also like to thank everyone who helped me hold this workshop.
